# Unity Pose 2D Control

A simple 2D platformer game demo. The player controls the character using a webcam and body poses.
The information about the body pose of the player is captured and extracted from python using the srcipts that I have written and published here:
[Pose Estimation For Unity](https://github.com/k-timy/pose-estimation-for-unity).

I created this pjoject in my free time as a challenge for myself.
Feel free to reach out to me about this project.
